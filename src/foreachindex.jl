Parallelised `for` loop over the indices of an iterable.

It allows you to run normal Julia code on a GPU over multiple arrays - e.g. CuArray, ROCArray,
MtlArray, oneArray - with one GPU thread per index.

On CPUs at most `max_tasks` threads are launched, or fewer such that each thread processes at least
`min_elems` indices; if a single task ends up being needed, `f` is inlined and no thread is
launched. Tune it to your function - the more expensive it is, the fewer elements are needed to
amortise the cost of launching a thread (which is a few μs). The scheduler can be `:polyester`
to use Polyester.jl cheap threads or `:threads` to use normal Julia threads; either can be faster
depending on the function, but in general the latter is more composable.

# Examples
Normally you would write a for loop like this:
```julia
function f()
    x = Array(1:100)
    y = similar(x)
    for i in eachindex(x)
        @inbounds y[i] = 2 * x[i] + 1
    end
end
```

Using this function you can have the same for loop body over a GPU array:
```julia
using CUDA
import AcceleratedKernels as AK

function f()
    x = CuArray(1:100)
    y = similar(x)
    AK.foreachindex(x) do i
        @inbounds y[i] = 2 * x[i] + 1
    end
end
```

Note that the above code is pure arithmetic, which you can write directly (and on some platforms
it may be faster) as:
```julia
using CUDA
x = CuArray(1:100)
y = 2 .* x .+ 1
```

**Important note**: to use this function on a GPU, the objects referenced inside the loop body must
have known types - i.e. be inside a function. For example:
```julia
using oneAPI
import AcceleratedKernels as AK

x = oneArray(1:100)

# CRASHES - typical error message: "Reason: unsupported dynamic function invocation"
# AK.foreachindex(x) do i
#     x[i] = i
# end

function somecopy!(v)
    # Because it is inside a function, the type of `v` will be known
    AK.foreachindex(v) do i
        v[i] = i
    end
end

somecopy!(x)    # This works
```

Parallelised `for` loop over the indices along axis `dims` of an iterable.

It allows you to run normal Julia code on a GPU over multiple arrays - e.g. CuArray, ROCArray,
MtlArray, oneArray - with one GPU thread per index.

On CPUs at most `max_tasks` threads are launched, or fewer such that each thread processes at least
`min_elems` indices; if a single task ends up being needed, `f` is inlined and no thread is

# Examples
Normally you would write a for loop like this:
```julia
function f()
    x = Array(reshape(1:30, 3, 10))
    y = similar(x)
    for i in axes(x, 2)
        for j in axes(x, 1)
            @inbounds y[j, i] = 2 * x[j, i] + 1
        end
    end
end
```

Using this function you can have the same for loop body over a GPU array:
```julia
using CUDA
import AcceleratedKernels as AK

function f()
    x = CuArray(reshape(1:3000, 3, 1000))
    y = similar(x)
    AK.foraxes(x, 2) do i
